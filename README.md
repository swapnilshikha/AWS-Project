# 🌩️ AWS Infrastructure Deployment Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a scalable and secure web application architecture using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It was developed as part of a hands-on internship focused on cloud computing fundamentals and practical implementation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project involves creating a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with the following components:

* ✅ **Public Subnet** with **2+ Web Servers**
* 🔐 **Private Subnet** with a **MySQL Database Server**
* ⚖️ **Application Load Balancer** (with domain + SSL)
* 🔄 **Auto Scaling Group** for scalability
* 🌐 **Route 53** for domain name resolution
* 🔒 **OpenVPN Setup** for secure access

---

## 🧠 Objectives

* Understand AWS core services and networking
* Gain practical experience in cloud infrastructure setup
* Learn secure and scalable cloud architecture design
* Deploy and manage resources using best practices

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Services Used

* **Amazon EC2** – Virtual servers for hosting applications
* **Amazon S3** – Object storage (optional, for future expansion)
* **Amazon RDS** – Relational Database (MySQL)
* **VPC** – Network isolation and access control
* **Route 53** – DNS and domain mapping
* **Load Balancer** – Distribute incoming traffic
* **Auto Scaling** – Automatic scaling based on demand
* **OpenVPN** – Secure remote access to private resources
